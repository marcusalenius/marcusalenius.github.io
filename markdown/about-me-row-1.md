Outside of technology, I am passionate about swimming, a sport I have loved my entire life. I am a former Swedish Age Group Champion in the 100 and 200 meters breaststroke. During my freshman year at Carnegie Mellon, I swam on the varsity swim team. For two years, I coached swimmers aged 7â€“11. Most recently, I announced swim meets in Sundsvall, Sweden, in 2022 and 2024, for which I developed an application to collect live stats for the announcer. In 2024, I also served as one of the announcers for the Swedish Age Group Championships.
